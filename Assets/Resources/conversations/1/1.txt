“J. Stevens”: Look, I know I’m your boss, but I also want you to see me as a friend. 
Absolutely.
“J. Stevens”: I know that it’s been a little strange since you came back, but that’s to be expected?
Yeah?
“J. Stevens”: Absolutely! Anytime that you get new skills, when you launch yourself beyond your co-workers, there’s bound to be some hurt feelings.
Sure. Doesn’t make it any better.
“J. Stevens”: For sure. But maybe that just means that you need to start spending more time in some ‘higher sections’
Higher sections?
“J. Stevens”: Yeah. Spend time focussing on more rewarding professional relationships.
Like you?
“J. Stevens”: Yeah, bro! Vanilla Sky as a double date was epic. Cameron Crowe in top form!
Totally.
“J. Stevens”: And Penelope Cruz…..yeah man. You know what I’m sayin…
LOL. 
“J. Stevens”: Ha! Don’t worry about it. I know what you’re going through. I know what it’s like. I got you, bro.
Thanks, Mr. Stevens.
“J. Stevens”: Anyway, stop dicking around and get that fucking RM-76 report, Garrison.
Yes, Mr. Stevens.
