“Steve”: HECTOR THE SPECTER!!!!
Hey Steve.
“Steve”: Yo, dude, I just saw something AMAZING on the world wide web today 
I’m afraid to ask.
“Steve”: So there’s this girl with huuuuge tits riding this mechanical bull
Dude, not work talk
“Steve”: And out of nowhere the bull goes fucking HAYWIRE
Wait, what?
“Steve”: Spinning like 100 mph, and the girls hand is stuck in the harness
So what happens?
“Steve”: I’m not sure yet actually, it’s still downloading
You’re watching this at work?
“Steve”: Yeah man! Maybe not cool? We should make a code for this kind of stuff though.
DNWWW. Do Not Watch While Working?
“Steve”: Really? DNWWW? Doesn’t really roll off the tongue...
Not Appropriate At Work? 
“Steve”: NAAW….love it!
