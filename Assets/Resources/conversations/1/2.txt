“J. Stevens”: Garrison, I need you to do something for me.
You got it, Mr. Stevens
“J. Stevens”: I need you to give me a report on the other people in your workspace.
What? Which people?
“J. Stevens”: I can’t really say, but we need to “clear some space”, if you get my drift.
Does this have anything to do with the holiday party?
“J. Stevens”: I told you not to bring that up. No.
Sorry. 
“J. Stevens”: Just look around and tell me if anybody in your area looks like a lazy dirtbag.
Right now?
“J. Stevens”: I don’t know, are there any lazy dirtbags around you RIGHT NOW?!
Like to my left and/or right?
“J. Stevens”: Exactly. Look to your left. Look to your right. If you see anything fishy I want you to “stretch.” I’ll know what you mean.
Alright, sir. Will do.
“J. Stevens”: Josh, management is talking about how what a ‘team player’ you’ve become.
I do my best, sir.
“J. Stevens”: You had better. I’m watching your ass.
As you should, sir.
