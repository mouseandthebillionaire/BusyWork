Dear Mr. Jacoby,

Thank you again for taking the time to look over the piece that I sent in. It means a lot to have someone in your position willing to give me feedback. Let me know what changes I can make. Or if you have any other ideas about the ending. Thanks again, and I hope to hear some good news soon!

Sincerely,

Hector Smith
